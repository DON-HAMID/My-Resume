    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an IT Service Management (ITSM) professional with over seven years of
      experience, dedicated to transforming IT support from a reactive function
      into a strategic business enabler. Most recently, within a major
      Industrial Packaging Factory, I led the full-cycle implementation of
      ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Cloud, transforming the support function
      into a structured, measurable operation capable of keeping pace with
      high-volume manufacturing demands.

        Key Contributions &amp; Impact

          <li>
            Change Leadership: Spearheaded the organizational culture shift to
            overcome resistance to new systems. I successfully drove adoption by
            demonstrating the clear operational benefits to stakeholders,
            ensuring the platform was embraced rather than just enforced.
          </li>
          <li>
            Process Optimization: Designed and deployed dynamic templates,
            automated rules, and optimized workflows to shift the service desk
            from reactive troubleshooting to a proactive, process-driven
            environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Training &amp; Adoption: Conducted comprehensive training for all
            departments on service requests and incident reporting, ensuring
            consistent system adoption across the organization. Performance
            Improvement: Enhanced ticket routing accuracy and Service Level
            Agreement (SLA) tracking, resulting in measurable increases in user
            satisfaction and operational efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuous Improvement: Applied ITIL best practices and data-driven
            insights to interpret performance metrics, standardize operations,
            and align IT services with organizational excellence goals.

        ITIL Specialization &amp; Framework Application
        <ul>
          <li>
            Service Management: Change Enablement, Incident Management, IT Asset
            Management, Monitoring &amp; Event Management, Problem Management,
            Release Management, Service Catalog Management, Service
            Configuration Management, Service Continuity Management, Service
            Design, Service Desk, Service Level Management, and Service Request
            Management.
          </li>
          <li>
            I facilitate these practices by strictly adhering to the ITIL 4
            Guiding Principles. Whether I am optimizing a workflow ("Think and
            work holistically") or deploying a new tool ("Start where you are"
            and "Optimize and automate"), I ensure every decision drives value.
            Furthermore, I ensure sustainable success by balancing the Four
            Dimensions of Service Management—aligning Organizations &amp;
            People, Information &amp; Technology, Partners &amp; Suppliers, and
            Value Streams &amp; Processes to prevent silos and ensure seamless
            delivery.

            In parallel with my ITSM work, I am actively mastering full-stack

            technical capabilities.
